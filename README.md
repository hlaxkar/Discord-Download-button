# Discord Image Downloader

The Discord Image Downloader is a browser extension that allows you to easily download images shared in Discord chat messages. With this extension, you can quickly save images to your local machine without the need for additional steps or manual downloads.

## Features

- Download images directly from Discord chat messages with a single click.
- Automatically add a download button to every chat message containing images.
- Support for both existing and new chat messages.
- Seamless integration with Discord's user interface.

## How It Works

The Discord Image Downloader extension leverages JavaScript and browser APIs to enhance your Discord experience and simplify image downloads. Here's how it works:

1. The extension injects a script into the Discord web interface, enabling it to manipulate and enhance the chat messages.
2. When the extension is active, it scans all chat messages and identifies those containing images.
3. For each image-containing message, it adds a download button dynamically to allow easy downloading of the image.
4. It also listens for new messages in real-time and automatically adds download buttons to any new chat messages that contain images.
5. When a user clicks the download button, the extension initiates the image download process using the browser's built-in download functionality.
